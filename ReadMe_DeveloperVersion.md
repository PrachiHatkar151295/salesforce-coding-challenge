Note:
- Have mentioned the refinement points inside the classes itself.
- Have developed two flows based on two separate solutions:
    1. SyncNPSSystem flow is developed without using an invocable apex class. Instead HTTPCallout Action provided by the Salesforce Flows is used.
    2. SyncNPSSystem_Alternate flow is developed incorporating the invicable apex class.
    Any one of the two solutions/flows can be deployed to check the feature.
- Assign NPS_Named_Credential PS to the user initiating the update of marking the Orders as Fulfilled and in turn, invoking the NPS API.
- A manifest file is maintained with the solution in GIT repo to keep a track of components deployed.
